This is a for fun project I made in the summer of 2024 before freshman year of college to automate certain tasks in a minecraft server called TrappedMC.
Currently all features of the program are undetectable from the server. 
Note that this program is designed to be played in 1920x1080 in windowed mode with fullbright enabled and does not work with any retextures of the game. 

Current features
GUI to change basic settings and start the program, as well as basic hotkeys. 
Press esc at any time to end the program and open the GUI. 
Hotkeys for /condense and /sellall. 
Holding M1 and W, while condensing and selling ores every x seconds to make mining easier.
Autofishing - Automatically fishes and sells the fish via the in game server GUI
Autofarming - Harvests and replants multiple layers of farm plots and sells harvested crops

Future features 
Automining  
Auto chat games - be able to read through the chat and complete server chat games
