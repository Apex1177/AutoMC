This is a for fun project I made in the summer of 2024 before freshman year of college. 
This is a program that automates certain tasks of the game minecraft, more specifically the tasks in a minecraft server called TrappedMC. 
It has features such as automatic fishing, mining, chat games, ect. (some of these are still in developement)
