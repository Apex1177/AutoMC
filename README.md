This is a for fun project I made in the summer of 2024 to automate certain tasks in minecraft.
Some modifications are done so that it can be used on specific minecraft server. 
Note that this program is designed to be played in 1920x1080 in windowed mode with fullbright enabled and does not work with any retextures/reskins of the game. 
This program was designed for my specific setup and is not configured to run on any machine. 

Current features
GUI to change basic settings and start the program, as well as see basic hotkeys. 
Press esc at any time to end the program and open the GUI. 
Hotkeys for /condense and /sellall. 
Holding M1 and W, while condensing and selling ores every x seconds to make mining easier.
Autofishing - Automatically fishes and sells the fish via the in game server GUI
